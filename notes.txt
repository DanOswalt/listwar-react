what's working:

create a list. this list should go into its own database, the user should only have a ref to id.

list id doesn't get pushed to user.lists until completed.

lists should only contain the lists, not the results or even who made the list?

when user goes to /list/:listId/:slug,

the app will look for a user,
if the user is logged in, then it will check the user to see if that list is in user.lists.
-if so, look and see if in user.results

if user does not have it in lists....

if a user receives shared list, does that become part of their lists? sure. if they have ever
opened a list, it will be in their lists as uncompleted.

so: list shows any list created or opened.
if a user has completed the list, they cannot complete it again.
resulsts are in a separate collection.
their ids could be userid+listid.

so: if a user recieves a list url
it will get saved to their lists.
then check for results.
if no result, green button will lead to "War", if result.
if result, green button will lead to "My Result" or something, message should explain.
