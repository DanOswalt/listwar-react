firebase hookup
all anonymous-user
animated battle
ui mobile focused
leave open for auth, if i want to add it (for saving lists)

routes:

home '/' (default back and redirect) //show lists? anonymous user in fb?
|
|
create '/create' (back = home)
|
|
howto '/howto' (explanation and 3 example lists)
|
|
listview '/list/:list-id/:list-slug/start (back=home)
|
|---- 404 '/list/notfound' (back=home, redirect here if /list/*)
|
listwar 'list/:list-id/:list-slug/war (back=listview, redirect to listview)
|
|
listresult 'list/:list-id/:list-slug/myresult (back=home) //how to determine who, session?
|
|
listresults 'list/:list-id/:list-slug/allresults (back=myresult)

all list routes should have a footer nav with cancel, share, confirm
header, title

dialogue modals?

User stories:

Main ideas:
I can create a list.
I can complete the war.
I can view my result (same url).
I can share my with others.
I can see everyone who has done my list.
I can be anonymous, yet see my results later via local storage or anon session.

I can open a url of a list that is new to me and start at listview.
I can open a url a list I've already completed and see my result. (check stored listids)
I can view the results of everyone who has done the list only after completion.

On homepage, there's a short explanation of listwar, and a link for examples, my results, and create a list.

On examples page, I see a longer explanation.
When I click examples, I see 3 links for example lists.
When I click an example, I go to that listview.
When I click back, I return to the examples page.

x Connect firebase
- Create 1 example list
- Create reusable function to getListById(listId);
- Create button that connects and pulls up list in via examples page

- Create reusable function to getUserResultById(listId, userId) 
  // should first check user's completed lists ids array, can only view if completed

- Create reusable function to getAllResultsById(listId)
  // should first check user's completed lists ids array, can only view if completed
